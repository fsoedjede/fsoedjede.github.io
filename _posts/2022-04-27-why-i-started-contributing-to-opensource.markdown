During my growth as from Junior Developer to Senior Developer and Lead Dev,
I've come across some issues with the libraries I commonly use.

Being Junior Developer, I just dig into the library code to understand the bug and fix my code to make it work.

Growing to Intermediate then Senior Developer, I wanted to contribute to the projects I use to help them improve or add some features I'm missing.
That's how I started following the specific projects I use a lot like Symfony, EasyAdminBundle, etc.

Here, I list those projects and my contribution to them.
This list will be annually updated to help me follow my growth in contributing to opensource.

> One thing I learned contributing to opensource projects is:
> "My time is precious. The projects maintainers time is precious.
> It's easier to fix an issue when the context is clearly established and test case are provided."
