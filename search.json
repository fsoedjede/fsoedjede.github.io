Do not expect the content to be fully relevant or complete.\n\nDuring my growth as from Junior Developer to Senior Developer and Lead Dev, I‚Äôve come across some issues with the libraries I commonly use.\nBeing Junior Developer, I just dig into the library code to understand the bug and fix my code to make it work.\nGrowing to Intermediate then Senior Developer, I wanted to contribute to the projects I use to help them improve or add some features I‚Äôm missing. That‚Äôs how I started following the specific projects I use a lot like Symfony, EasyAdminBundle, etc.\nHere, I list those projects and my contribution to them. This list will be annually updated to help me follow my growth in contributing to opensource.\n\nOne thing I learned contributing to opensource projects is: ‚ÄúMy time is precious. The projects maintainers time is precious. It‚Äôs easier to fix an issue when the context is clearly established and test case are provided.‚Äù"

I just forget how I did it the first time.\n\n\nHow to proceed?\n\n1. Weblate documentation\nIn the documentation, I found the following paragraph which answer my question:\n\n\n\nOption ‚ÄúUpload translations files‚Äù visible\n\n\nLink: https://docs.weblate.org/en/weblate-4.11.2/admin/projects.html#adding-translation-projects-and-components\n\n\n2.

    "text": "Approach to solution\n\nNot being Devops, this solution can be totally trivial.\n\n\nOption 1: Use the --requirepass option\nExample:\nversion: '3.9'\nservices:\n    redis:\n        image: 'redis:5-alpine'\n        command: redis-server --requirepass mypassword\n        ports:\n            - '6379:6379'\nThis option is the one that I found the most, but it does not correspond to my need.\nIt does not allow to define a user and a password.\n\n\nOption 2: Create a configuration file to define the ACLs\nThis option meets my need in that I can have a specific user and password.\nFirst you have to create the file redis.conf with the following content:\nmasterauth password\n\n# @see: https://redis.io/docs/management/security/acl/\n## Totally disable anonymous access\nuser default off\n# Adds user \"development\" with the password \"mypassword\" and give the access to namespaces \"myproject:*\"\n# `#89e01536ac207279409d4de1e5253e01f4a1769e696db0d6062ca9b8f56767c8` corresponds to the SHA-256 password for the user.\nuser development on ~myproject:* &* +@all -@dangerous #89e01536ac207279409d4de1e5253e01f4a1769e696db0d6062ca9b8f56767c8\nIn your docker-compose.yaml file, you should configure it like that:\nversion: '3.9'\nservices:\n    redis:\n        image: redis:5-alpine\n        command: [ 'redis-server', '/redis.conf' ]\n        ports:\n            - \"6379:6379\"\n        volumes:\n            - /redis.conf:/redis.conf:rw\nThat‚Äôs all üéâ.\nIf you are a Symfony user, you can configure the DSN like the following:\n# .env.local\nREDIS_URL=redis://development:mypassword@127.0.0.1:6379"
