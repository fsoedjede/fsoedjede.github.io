## Why this blog?

I was thinking to start a place when I would just write things.

Here I will write about:

- what I've learned doing my regular work
- what I've learned from others
- things I stuck on to never again think a lot about them. I may also help others.

This place is also to improve:

- my knowledge of what I'm writing by going deeper
- my writing skills
- my coding/architectural skills
- etc.

I'm here to improve everything that can be improved to be the best I can be in the IT field.

Finally, it's a place to:

- take some note for myself for the future

Interesting stuff I found while reading other blogs, things that can help in my work, etc.

- easily find my personal achievement

I'm not the type of person who notes everything he did, etc. I'm just a `doer`.\
I link doing things and doing them well.\
Now I'm trying to be a `writer` also to improve more than just reading, to express my creativity.
